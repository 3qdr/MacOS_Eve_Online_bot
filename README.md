### This is currently a Pyautogui + Tesseract Python program to automate gas mining in Eve Online on MacOS

### The project goal is to automate as many things as possible in Eve Online on MacOS

### Don't just download this and hope it will work, it WILL **NOT**.

### what you need to do is go into a system, bookmark the GAS(not the gas site), and bookmark the station, have your d-scan, overview, and inventory open, go to the station, have your inventory open there as well, then you will need to change some of the clicking positions in the program to your gui position, use the video demo below as a reference.

### No video here yet :) im lazy, ill do it later
